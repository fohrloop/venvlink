# ðŸ”— venvlink

Create virtual environments in one centralized folder, and proxy of `venv/Scripts/activate` still in your working folder!

# Installing
```
pip install venvlink
```



# Usage

## Simple example

Assume that you have a project at 

```
C:\workdir\someproject\
```
and that you are in command line inside that folder (call it, `<project_root>`). Then, you would like to create virtual environment for that folder.

Instead of the regular
```python
# at C:\workdir\someproject\
python -m venv venv
```

One would type

```python
# at C:\workdir\someproject\
python -m venvlink project-name
```

This would create the following folders:

```
C:\workdir\someproject\venv
   ^-- This has only few files, such as the "activate" script.

C:\<venvlink-venv-path>\project-name
   ^--- The actual virtual environment files are here!
```

The first folder is for using the virtual environment normally, just like you have used to (running `venv/Scripts/activate`) and the second folder is for storing the actual virtual environment files.

## Usage with linters (e.g. pylint)

Linters like `pylint` try to search for the packages intelligently from a virtual environment, if such exists. Placing virtual environment files outside of `<project>\venv\`, to for example `C:\Python\venvs\myproj` will have the side effect that linters might not find your modules. This might cause false positive `import-error`s, like the one below.

### Fixing false positive `import-error`s
You have to tell to the linter that you are using, where to look for the modules. 

**`pylint`**<br><br>
Add following init hook

```
--init-hook "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'C:/Python/venvs/myenv/Lib/site-packages')"
```
- Replace `'C:/Python/venvs/myenv'` with the virtual environment path of your project
- Note that the path separator is ***forward*** slash `/`


**VSCode & `pylint`**<br><br>
To configure `pylint` in VSCode, you need to
- Open `Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)` (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- Add there the following:

```json
{
    "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
        "--init-hook",
        "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'C:/Python/venvs/myenv/Lib/site-packages')",
        "--disable=all",
        "--enable=F,E,unreachable,duplicate-key,unnecessary-semicolon,global-variable-not-assigned,unused-variable,binary-op-exception,bad-format-string,anomalous-backslash-in-string,bad-open-mode"
    ],
}
```
- The `--disable=all` and `--enable=...` are optional, but you want to keep them if you are not using a `pylintrc` file, and you are used to the [default filtering VSCode does for you](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_default-pylint-rules).
